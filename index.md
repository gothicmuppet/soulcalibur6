# My review
SC6 is a prequel that happens between 2 & 3. I was not sure about buying the season passes. I have issues a few issues at first.

Pros
- Base game starts with 23 characters

Cons
- Nobody has their own unique stages
- Everything is behind a paywall. characters, old music, stages
- there is only one costume per character. the rest our color swaps.
- Libra of souls is too long
- A few old characters are missing: Rock, Lizardman, Charade, and Yun Seong. I might as well play any of the past SoulCalbiur games.
- Guest characters can be overpowering.
